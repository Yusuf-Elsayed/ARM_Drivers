# Flash Driver

**Author:** Yusuf Elsayed

## Description

This repository contains a Flash driver for STM32F401CC (The Black Pill). The driver provides functions for erasing and writing to the Flash memory of the microcontroller.

## Features

- Mass erase of Flash memory
- Sector erase of Flash memory
- Flash data write

## Getting Started

### Usage

1. Include the driver header file:

   ```c
   #include "FD_inteface.h"
   ```

2. Initialize the driver:

   ```c
   // Initialize the driver (if needed)
   // ...
   ```

3. Use the driver functions as needed:

   ```c
   // Example usage of mass erase
   Flash_voidMassErase();
   
   // Example usage of sector erase
   Flash_voidSectorErase(SECTOR_NUMBER);
   
   // Example usage of data write
   u32 data = 0x12345678;
   Flash_voidFlashWrite(FLASH_ADDRESS, &data, sizeof(data));
   ```

### Documentation

For detailed documentation and function descriptions, please refer to the header files (`FD_inteface.h`, `FD_private.h`) and comments in the source code.
